<h1>Background Every Web Developer Needs to Know</h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this article I'll describe the World Wide Web from a high level
perspective, focusing on how a web page is request and delivered from a
web server to a web browser. Then, I want to talk about web browsers,
how they interpret the HTML you write, differences between browsers, what
are standards and to paraphrase the old joke "if Standards are so great,
why are there so many of them?" Finally, I'll talk about the throught
process behing HTML5 and CSS3, why they were introduced and what they
hope to achieve.</p>

<h2>A Brief Technical Overview of the World Wide Web</h2>

The World Wide Web started out as a means for sharing scientific
resources like research documentation between governmental and academic
institutions. It took time for the technologies and practices to evolve 	
beyond its original purpose.

<p>From a technical perspective, the World Wide Web is comprised of
several technologies ... first, it involves a simple markup (the Hyper-
text Markup Language, or HTML) to both structure and format textual
information. When first introduces its claim to fame was the hyperlink
which allowed the publisher of a document to add a link to other research
paper available from across the world, creating a virtual web of
information (thus, the name). Second, one or more interlinked pages are
published to a server that is connected to an open network which we know
today as the Internet.</p> 

<p>A protocol was devised that specialized in allowing a
request/response-style communication between two computers. In other
words, one user requests a document by typing and address for a document
into a special program called a web browser, and the web browser packages
up that request and sends it out into the network. The request takes the
form of a specially formatted packet of data. You can think of this
packet of information like a self-addressed stamped evelope --
containing both the address of the information requested and the address
where that information should be sent back to. This specially formatted
packet is known as Hyper-text Transfer Protocol, or rather, HTTP, and for
simplicity's sake you can think of it merely as an electronic envelope.
See Figure 1 for the types of information sent in the HTTP Request and
HTTP Response messages.</p>

  important information that allows communication back and forth
  between the client and the server.
	</figcaption>
 </figure>

 <p>
  The HTTP request message is routed through a series of network wires and routers (i.e., devices that know how to forward HTTP messages closer to their destination) 
  spanning the globe using (ideally) the shortest route possible until it arrives at its destination, the web server at the address the requestor typed into the web browser.  
  The web server responds to the request by locating the requested document or resource (in the figure, the index.html file), packaging it up using the same HTTP style envelope, then sending the requested document back on to the network.  The connection would only take a fraction of a second and once the computer served up the request, it would not retain any information about that request in its memory.  
  See Figure 2 for a diagram of interactivity between the client and server computers.

user request to the web server and back again" />

internet to the

HTTP Response message. (5) The HTTP Response is routed across the
internet to the original requestor. (6) The requested file is parsed and 
displayed in the user's web browser.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once the requested document is delivered through the network back to 
requestor, that document is loaded into the web browser. The browser
parses through the HTML and decides how to render (or rather, display)
its content and appearance on the computer screen.</p>

<h2>What are Domain Names?</h2>

<p>The request that users type into web browsers originally looked something like this:

http://157.123.23.44/index.htm

Why the series of numbers? Each computer on this network was assigned an address, called an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address. This was assigned through a lower-level protocol called Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol, or rather, TCP/IP. It was the foundational technology that allowed requests to be routed to the appropriate server that contained a given resource, or rather, web page. However, because the IP address for a computer would change occasionally for a given computer or institution, they devised a system called the Domain Name System, or rather, the DNS, to turn a friendly name like:
mit.edu
... into the actual "location", like:
18.72.0.3


A system of top-level Domain Names was created ... .edu for educational institutions, .mil for Military, .gov for Government, .net for Network related resources, .org for Non-profit organizations, .com for Commercial organizations, etc. Later, other countries and a plethora of top-level domains were added and others for commercial and other interests.

The web browser will query databases of domain names and their associated IP Addresses and will translate the requests automatically for the user without his or her knowledge. Typically, each Internet Service Provider has a Domain Name System server that can be queried for resolving Domain Names into IP Addresses. The databases that contain this Domain Name information stay synchronized around the globe, although sometimes the synchronization process can take minutes or hours to complete.
</p>

<h3>The purpose for Standards Groups</h3>

<p>At every step of the way, one or more organizations were formed to help identify standards for these technologies comprised of experts and luminaries who were pushing these technologies forward. They would meet both virtually and in person to define and discuss the merits of adding new features to a given standard and would encourage organizations who were creating hardware and software to follow these standards so that products from different vendors could work together seamlessly. Perhaps one of the most influential and important standards body you will hear about is the W3C, or rather, the World Wide Web Consortium. They were one of the groups responsible for the latest version of HTML, version 5. Another is the WHATWG, or rather, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, which is comprised of a subset of the W3C and several additional experts and organizations that have a vested interest in the vitality of the World Wide Web. The background of HTML5, the previous versions of HTML, as well as the standards organizations involved is fascinating because you get a peek into both the process and the politics of these organizations.

<h2>Recap of the World Wide Web Technical Overview</h2>

<p>From a purely technical perspective, you should now understand a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>First of all, hopefully you now have an answer to the question everyone first starting out asks: "why the heck did they make URLs so convoluted? Wouldn't it be easier to just type in 'microsoft' instead of 'http://www.microsoft.com'?"
There's an evolution of technologies, and furthermore, it was never intended for use by the masses. At some point commercialized and individual access to the internet dwarfed the intended use, however the technologies created 30 years ago are still in play.
</li>
     
<li>Second, hopefully you will begin see the purpose of things 
like http:// ... in which you are saying you want to access a specific channel of traffic, HTTP, or rather, World Wide Web traffic, as opposed to FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for working with large files, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending email, and so on.
</li>
     
<li>Third, hopefully you see the purpose of .com, .edu, .net and so on ... at least, you understand the original purpose, and you understand how those domain names are translated into the actual IP Addresses that are utilized by routers to move traffic around the internet to it's intended destination.</li>
  

<li>Fourth, hopefully you can see that the specifics of HTML - and all other standards - are decided on by a body of individuals who understand what is needed and propose and debate the merits of adding or removing parts of a given specification.
You should also see the purpose for these standards - so that organizations creating hardware and software to support the World Wide Web can achieve a high degree of interoperability.</li>

<li>Fifth, hopefully you can see the role that each component plays in the exchange of documents and other resources ... 
the web browser is responsible for interacting with the end user who requests a document by typing in a web address or clicks on a hyperlink. It also packages up that request and begins the process of requesting the document from it's host, the computer called the web server. 
The message is packaged using the HTTP protocol, which you can think of as an electronic envelope geared towards stateless request / response style transmissions between two computers. 
Routers are special devices that know how to interpret the address encoded in electronic envelopes, or rather, the HTTP messages, and route them closer to their ultimate destination.
A web server is merely a computer at a given web address that is listening for HTTP requests, and if the address is valid, returns the requested document or resource using the same HTTP message addressing as a response.</li>
</ol>
<h2>One Final Note About Our Overview</h2>
<p>
  Let me add that (a) I distilled this down and over-simplified it to keep it simple at a high level. You could spend months or years 
  learning more about any single component of what I just described in a few sentences, and (b) after 30 years of use and technological advancement, web development has gotten a LOT more sophisticated. 
  And most pertinent to this series of lessons, web development techniques and technologies have become much more sophisticated. While most of the underpinnings are still in play, some of the technologies have been refined and expanded.
</p>

<p>
  Take HTML for example. In early versions, HTML was called on to do "double-duty" ... it expressed both the structure of a document as well as its aesthetic layout.
  In other words, the same syntax defined both the fact that there would be fie paragraphs separated by a series of headings indicating the relationship of those paragraphs to each other, AS WELL AS the font types, colors and sizes, the border around the web page, the rounded corners and other adornments to make the web page attractive.
  While scientists and academicians may not be overly concerned about the aesthetics, at least not 30 years ago, now the World Wide Web is used for eCommerce, web applications that mimic desktop applications, gaming and more.
</p>

<p>
  More recently, these two responsibilities - of structure and presentation - have been split in two ... HTML should define the structure of the document, and Cascading Style Sheets should control the presentation, or rather, the style or aesthetic qualities of a web page. 
  We'll see how this separation of responsibilities plays out throughout this course
</p>

<h2>How Web Browsers Parse HTML</h2>
<p>One final topic I want to talk about that affects modern web development is the implementations of various web browsers.
 As you'll recall, once the requested web page has been returned, it will be parsed by a web browser then displayed on screen.</p>
<p>There are four major parsing and rendering engines that are popular today.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trident, the web browser engine from Internet Explorer, is used by many applications on the Microsoft Windows platform, such as netSmart, Outlook Express, some versions of Microsoft Outlook, and the mini-browsers in Winamp and RealPlayer.</li>
      <li>Gecko, the Mozilla project's open-source web browser engine, is used by a variety of products derived from the Mozilla code
      base, including the Firefox web browser, the Thunderbird e-mail client, and SeaMonkey internet suite.</li>
      <li>Opera Software's proprietary Presto engine is licensed to a number of other software vendors, and is used in Opera's own web browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They are *mostly* the same, in so much that a web page will look mostly the same regardless of which web browser it is loaded into. However it is the differences between them that most people discuss because it provides design challenges.</p>
    <h2>What do I mean when I use the terms "parse" and "render"?</h2>
   <p>
    The term "parse" refers to the process of breaking apart the 
    HTML document to better "understand" the instructions coded there in. During this phase, other resources, like external CSS files or JavaScript files, or images, must be requested so that the browser can get a complete picture of the code it is responsible for ultimately rendering. After all those external resources are downloaded and analyzed, they are typically loaded into the computer's memory as a tree, or hierarchy, of software objects then passed to the rendering engine component of the browser - more about that in a moment. When I refer to these hierarchical software objects, I simply mean that some objects "own" or are parents to other objects ... a simple example might be that a paragraph is a parent to each sentence, which is a parent to each word. There might be other tags and graphical elements that the paragraph owns as well. This is simply part of the process of deciding 
    what technique the browser will use to ultimately render the HTML to the screen.
